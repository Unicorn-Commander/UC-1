# Unicorn Commander & Magic Unicorn Themes - Project Status (Plasma 6)

## ‚úÖ Completed
- Magic Unicorn Light and Dark themes are visible and selectable in Global Themes
- Theme switcher script finishes automatically (no Enter required)
- Installer copies all required files and creates Plasma 6-compatible structure for all themes
- manifest.json and metadata.json created for all themes
- Placeholder layout scripts and required directories created for all themes
- Window decoration (UnicornCommander) is present and available

## üöß In Progress / To Do
- Panels (top menu bar, dock) for Magic Unicorn themes do not auto-create (Plasma 6 scripting API for panels has changed; awaiting updated documentation or working example)
- Unicorn Commander Light and Dark themes: verify full functionality and panel layout after new metadata files
- Quick Settings: Custom themes do not appear in Quick Settings (research required for Plasma 6 integration)
- Window Decorations: Need a Mac-style aurorae theme for Magic Unicorn; refine both Mac and Windows styles for authenticity
- Icon Theme: Ensure correct icons and unicorn branding for all themes and variants
- Panel Layout Scripts: Update with Plasma 6-compatible scripting when available
- Documentation: Continue updating guides and README for Plasma 6 specifics

## üìù Notes
- KDE Plasma 6 has significant changes to theme structure and scripting; some features (like scripted panel layouts) may not be fully supported yet.
- Manual panel setup via KDE GUI may be required until scripting is updated.
- Monitor KDE documentation and forums for updates on scripting and theme requirements.
