# Frequently Asked Questions

## General Questions

### What is UC-1?
UC-1 is a complete AI automation platform that runs entirely on your hardware. It combines local language models, document intelligence, automation agents, and web search in a privacy-focused, self-hosted environment.

### Do I need an internet connection?
After initial setup, UC-1 works completely offline. Internet is only needed for:
- Initial installation and updates
- Optional web search through SearXNG
- Downloading additional AI models

### How is this different from ChatGPT?
- **Privacy**: Your data never leaves your device
- **No Subscriptions**: One-time purchase, no monthly fees
- **Customizable**: Full control over models and configuration
- **Automation**: The Colonel agent can actually perform tasks on your computer
- **Local Processing**: No rate limits or service outages

## Hardware & Performance

### What are the minimum requirements?
- **CPU**: 4+ cores, 2.0 GHz
- **RAM**: 16GB minimum, 32GB+ recommended
- **Storage**: 100GB free space
- **GPU**: AMD with Vulkan support (recommended but not required)

### Will it work on my existing computer?
If you're running Ubuntu 20.04+ (or compatible Linux) with the minimum specs, yes! The UC-1 Founders Edition hardware is optimized for AI workloads, but the software stack runs on many configurations.
